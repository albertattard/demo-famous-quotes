# Famous Quotes

A simple Spring Boot web application that returns a random famous quote by a
famous person from the database through its single REST endpoint.

```
GET '/quote/random'
```

This will return a JSON object similar to the following.

```json
{
  "author": "Robert H. Schuller",
  "quote": "Tough times never last but tough people do."
}
```

This example makes use of the following tech-stack

- [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and
  [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot),
  [Spring Web Starter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/index.html),
  and
  [Spring Data JPA starter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/data-access.html)
- [H2 in-memory database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html), and
- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/).

and it was created using the
[Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.3.2&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=21&groupId=demo&artifactId=demo-famous-quotes&name=Famous%20Quotes%20Demo&description=A%20simple%20Spring%20Boot%20web%20application%20that%20exposes%20one%20end-point%20which%20returns%20a%20random%20famous%20quote%20from%20a%20famous%20person.&packageName=demo&dependencies=web,h2,data-jpa).

## Prerequisites

- [Oracle Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)

## Run the example

1. Build the application and run the unit and integration tests.

   Do not run the integration tests directly (`mvn integration-test`), as these
   will not stop the application, and the Tomcat server will stay running in the
   background without generating the required metadata. Furthermore, failing
   tests will not cause the build fail as the integration tests run all tests,
   and it does not fail. The verify process takes the results and fails
   accordingly.

   ```shell
   ./mvnw clean verify
   ```

   All tests should pass.

   (_Optional_) List the created fat JAR file.

   ```shell
   tree --charset=ascii --dirsfirst --sort=name -L 1 --prune './target'
   ```

   The fat (ends with _.jar_) and the thin (ends with _.jar.original_) JAR files

   ```
   ./target
   |-- demo-famous-quotes-1.0.0.jar
   `-- demo-famous-quotes-1.0.0.jar.original

   1 directory, 2 files
   ```

2. Run the Java application

   ```shell
   java -jar './target/demo-famous-quotes-1.0.0.jar'  > './target/output.txt' 2>&1 &
   ```

   Wait for the application to start.

   ```shell
   while [ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' 'http://localhost:8080/quote/random')" -ne '200' ]; do sleep 1; done
   ```

   Request a random quote

   ```shell
   curl --silent 'http://localhost:8080/quote/random' | jq
   ```

   The response may vary, but it should have the following properties.

   ```json
   {
     "id": 1,
     "author": "Nelson Mandela",
     "quote": "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."
   }
   ```

3. Stop the application when ready

   ```shell
   kill "$(jcmd | grep 'demo-famous-quotes-1.0.0.jar' | cut -d' ' -f1)"
   ```
